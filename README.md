# Counter-Strike: Source server for Vultr

Repo is in two parts:
 - 01-image: build a snapshot with packer
 - 02-server: deploy a server with terraform

They can be run separately. The server can then be created and destroyed at will.

You will need to create ENVIRONMENT and 02-server/terraform.tfvars from the given examples.
